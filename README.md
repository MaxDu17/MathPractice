# Timed Mental Math Practice

This python project gives you math questions and times how long you take to answer them. You choose, via command line, which type of math problem you want. Right now, we can do multiply, add, and subtract among teens, double digits, and double-single digits. This is more of a project for myself, but if anyone wants to use it, be my guest!

### Prerequisites

None--this uses the incuded random library and that's about it. 

```
print(foo)
```
